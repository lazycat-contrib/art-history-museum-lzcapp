# Development guide

Setup, data updates, deployment and verification for contributors. For the museum itself, see the [README](../README.md).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

The app reads the bundled snapshot, so that's all you need. Optional extras:

```bash
# Set WIKI_USER_AGENT first (see .env.example): Wikimedia asks every client
# to identify itself.

# Pull the collection from Wikipedia. Resumable: each artist is cached in
# data/wikipedia/artists, and --refresh re-fetches them all.
npm run ingest
npm run ingest -- --refresh

# Re-check the snapshot in place (non-artworks, images, dates, sizes,
# copyright, credits) and write a report. --dry-run writes nothing.
npm run repair-data

# Refresh only the enrichment (sizes, pageviews, ids, dates).
npm run enrich             # --dry-run, --keep-years, --keep-foreign

# Copy the gallery music into public/audio (needs ffmpeg with AAC).
npm run fetch-music

# Load the snapshot into Postgres (e.g. Neon) and read from it instead:
# put DATABASE_URL in .env.local, then
npm run load-db            # --allow-removals to drop artists the cache lacks
```

With `WIKI_HTTP_CACHE=<dir>` the scripts save API responses on disk. File
metadata and Wikidata claims also reuse records by file or item, so changed
batch boundaries don't trigger lookups of unchanged works.

`load-db` fills staging tables and swaps them in with one short transaction,
so it can run against a live database. Every gallery is prerendered at build
time and refreshed hourly.

### Data archive and the site snapshot

Other sources (WikiArt so far), Wikidata life facts, our own taxonomy
(`data/taxonomy/`) and a DuckDB warehouse in our own format
(`data/museum.duckdb`) are run by a local Dagster (`run_dagster.cmd`,
<http://127.0.0.1:3080>). See [`archive/README.md`](../archive/README.md).

The site reads `data/site/museum.json` when it exists: the ingest's snapshot
plus the works only WikiArt has, for public-domain artists. Otherwise it reads
`data/wikipedia/museum.json`. The full refresh, in order:

```bash
npm run ingest && npm run repair-data          # data/wikipedia
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.wikimedia manifest
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.wikidata artists
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.warehouse build
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.fingerprints
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.warehouse build
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.site   # data/site/museum.json, rooms.json (`archive.site rooms`: rooms.json only)
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.guide build   # data/site/guide: audio guide scripts
archive/.venv/Scripts/python -m archive.phases        # data/site/phases.json: the phases galleries follow
npm run load-db                                # reads data/site when present
```

(or Dagster's `wikidata_facts` then `warehouse_build` jobs after the ingest).
WikiArt images load from `uploads*.wikiart.org`, allowed in the CSP
(`next.config.ts`).

## How it's built

- **Routes:** `/` the timeline; `/museum/<artist>` an artist's gallery (prerendered); `/rooms` make a room and
  `/room?...` walk it (rendered on request: the selection, the room's design and its floor plan are the URL,
  `src/lib/room-query.ts`, chosen and hung by `src/lib/rooms.ts`; a room with floors has `&f=2` ..., joined by an
  elevator by the entrance); `/museums/<slug>` a recreated museum (`src/lib/museum-rooms.ts`), an ordinary room
  link; `/api/room` the picker's live count and preview (`?preview=1`); `/api/room/works?q=` the picker's search for works to add (title and
  artist words, `&a=` one artist's best known); the picker's drag and drop is `src/app/rooms/drag.ts` (a moved
  work is recorded in the link as `artist/painting@floor:place`, only the works moved); `/api/guide/<artist>` the audio guide's scripts (`data/site/guide`); `/api/work/<artist>/<work>` a work's
  tags, museums and same-year works for the inspect panel; `/surprise?from=<artist>` a gallery from another
  period (the "Surprise me" at a gallery's end); `/furniture` (development only) every
  room style's furniture (the layout picks among it room by room), for modelling it.

- **Next.js 16** (App Router). The timeline and all 572 galleries are
  prerendered; data comes from the JSON snapshot (`data/site`).
- **React Three Fiber / three.js** galleries that only render when something
  changes (`frameloop="demand"`), so standing still costs no frames.
- **Suites** draw only what you can see: the neighbouring rooms, the works near
  you, and a fixed pool of 16 spotlights handed to the works in view, so
  walking never recompiles a shader. Textures load in steps as you get closer
  (thumbnail, wall, close-up, inspect).
- **Images** load straight from Wikimedia's servers at fixed thumbnail widths
  ([`src/lib/img.ts`](../src/lib/img.ts)), retrying if Wikimedia is busy.

## The timeline

The timeline is coded from scratch in `src/components/timeline/`: React, plain
DOM and SVG, no charting library. GSAP only tweens the fly-tos (zoom on a log
scale, so a long flight feels like travel).

- **One transform.** Zoom and pan are one `{ k, x, y }` (`timeline-math.ts`):
  `k` stretches the years (1× to 80×), `x` pans, `y` scrolls a wall taller
  than the screen. Wheel, pinch and drag write to a ref, and React renders at
  most once per animation frame.
- **Layout is a pure function, rerun every frame.** `computeWallLayout` and
  `computeStarLayout` take the data, the viewport and the transform and return
  boxes in screen pixels: plain loops over 573 artists in 35 periods, with no
  layout reads from the DOM. What zoom doesn't change is computed once: the
  period lanes (`assignLanes`, best-fit interval packing), each star's year
  and each constellation's figure (a minimum spanning tree).
- **Gallery Wall.** Each period owns its own stretch of its lane, so rows can
  never collide and need no search. A bisection finds the row height at which
  the lanes near the screen share the height; lanes fade in and out smoothly,
  so nothing jumps.
- **Culling.** Every row and star has an `onScreen` flag (the screen plus a
  margin). Off screen it renders as an empty, memoised button parked outside
  the view, so the DOM keeps one focusable node per artist for Tab and screen
  readers, but only what is in view is drawn. Grid lines and axis ticks are a
  few SVG paths, and each constellation is one path.
- **Labels never overlap.** `text-measure.ts` measures each string once on a
  canvas at 100 px and scales it (an estimate until the web fonts load). Wall
  titles sit on a rail above each lane (`placeRail` in `label-place.ts`),
  inside their band or as a callout with a leader. The Star Map places
  portraits and names greedily, largest body of work first, on an occupancy
  grid of 32 px cells, and steers them off constellation lines. What doesn't
  fit waits until you zoom in.
- **Starfield.** Three pre-rendered SVG tiles, each moved by one compositor
  transform and twinkled by CSS opacity, so it never repaints. The Star Map
  uses no CSS filters.

No timeline frame times are recorded yet: `perf-probe.mjs` measures the 3D
galleries only. `node scripts/verify-e2e.mjs` checks that no two visible labels
overlap: with All artists on, in both views, at the overview and zoomed in;
and on the Star Map at eight screen sizes (360×740 to 1600×900). To time the
timeline, record a Chrome DevTools Performance trace while zooming with All
artists on.

## Performance

Measured with `node scripts/perf-probe.mjs <slug> <baseUrl>` on a production
build (October 2026; headless Chrome, ANGLE/D3D11 on an RTX 4070, 1600×900).
The nine-room Caravaggio suite was walked end to end. Draws and framebuffer
binds are per rendered frame while walking. All 28 shader programs were
linked behind the entry doors; the count stayed at 28 throughout the walk.

| Gallery | Rooms | Draws / frame | FB binds | Idle frames | Programs | Images at doors → after full walk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Caravaggio | 9 | 15–103 | 7 | 0 | 28 → 28 | 2.68 → 30.89 MB |

## Deploy

Any Node host works (`npm run build && npm start`, or the Dockerfile). On
Vercel the project builds as it is; set `DATABASE_URL` only if you use
Postgres.
