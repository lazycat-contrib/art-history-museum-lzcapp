// kept (★, some on the floor they hang on), so the room picker can open one, change it and save it like any other
// room. /museums/<slug> opens one. Floors, wall colours and key works follow each museum's floor plan and
// descriptions of its galleries (sources below); colours are estimates from those, the hanging is ours.
